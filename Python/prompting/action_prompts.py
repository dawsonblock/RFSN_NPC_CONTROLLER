LLM Action Sub-Prompts with Machine-Readable Headers.

This module provides strict control blocks for each NPCAction that constrain
the LLM to act as a "dialogue realizer" rather than an autonomous agent.

Each action subprompt includes:
- Machine-readable header with ACTION, MODE, SAFETY, STATE_SUMMARY
- Intent description (what the action means)
- Allowed content (bulleted list)
- Forbidden content (bulleted list)
- Style constraints (mood, relationship, affinity)
- Response length rules (explicit)
